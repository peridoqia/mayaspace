        <h2>About Maya</h2>
        <p>Maya is the cat of the Lord family as of 2020. Before her came Dixie, who (unfortunately) died not too long before we adopted Maya.</p>
        <h3>Why did you create MayaSpace?</h3>
        <p>I thought it was a good pun, and decided to make it real. (Thanks Mom and Dad for the pun!)</p>
        <h3>What is MayaSpace?</h3>
        <p>MayaSpace is a decentralized social media site where you can post posts, however it was originally a meme site. Everyone is treated equally, since there are no comments and likes, and everyone gets on the front page as soon as they post as well.</p>
        <h3>Do you love Maya?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Yes I do.</p>
